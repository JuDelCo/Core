Documentation
=====================

#### Services

- LogService
    * Handles all logging across all services and your code.
    * **Note**: The LogService is internally automatically registered for you.
- EventBusService
    * Useful event bus to communicate your objects in a decoupled way.
- DataService
    * Useful service to store a reference of all data in the application.
    * Handles individual multiple data types in lists and unique data types in shared mode.

#### Classes

- Observable
    * Generic type that handles action subscribers to value changes of any type.

#### Usage

First, create your service classes and make sure they inherit from IService interface.

```csharp
using Ju;

public class CustomService : IService
{
	public void Setup()
	{
  	// Here you can resolve the service dependencies.
	}

	public void Start()
	{
  	// Here you can initialize your service.
	}

	public void CustomMethod()
	{
	}
}
```

Then, at some point in the entry point of your program, register your services using:

```csharp
// Register a lazy service, it will initialize when used the first time only.
Services.RegisterLazyService<CustomService>();

// Register service and initialize them right away.
Services.RegisterService<CustomService>();
```

You can also register a object factory using:

```csharp
// A new object of type CustomClass will be created in each call.
// You can pass any function or lambda to build your new object.
Services.RegisterFactory<CustomClass>(() => new CustomClass());
```

Before the program finalizes, you should dispose the services using:

```csharp
// Dispose all services, also the event "OnApplicationQuit" will fire.
Services.Dispose();
```

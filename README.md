Core
=====================

Core is a service locator, object factory and a collection of basic services to ease the development of C# applications or games.

This package will follow a [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Any feedback is welcome !

Install
=====================

If you are using Unity, update the dependencies in the ```/Packages/manifest.json``` file in your project folder with:

```
	"com.judelco.core": "https://github.com/JuDelCo/Core.git#v1.12.0",
```

otherwise, use this package as it is in native C# applications, it will work just fine.


Contents
=====================

#### Services

- ```LogService```
    * Handles all logging across all services and your code.
    * **Note**: This service is internally automatically registered for you.
- ```EventBusService```
    * Useful event bus to communicate your objects in a decoupled way.
- ```DataService```
    * Useful service to store a reference of all data in the application.
    * Handles individual multiple data types in lists and unique data types in shared mode.
- ```CoroutineService```
    * Handles your coroutines state in plain C#, no MonoBehaviours used.
- ```TaskService```
    * Allows you to run tasks that need to be updated over time.
	* Exposes several helper functions that returns promises.

#### Services (Unity3D)

- ```LogUnityService```
    * Redirects all logs to Unity console (critical in Unity environments).
- ```UnityService```
    * Exposes several Unity engine events and ticks Coroutine and Task services.
- ```DataServiceUnityExtensions```
    * Add some helper methods to handle ScriptableObjects in DataService.

#### Classes

- ```Observable```
    * Generic type that handles action subscribers to value changes of any type.
- ```ObjectPool```
    * Simple generic object pool using a stack internally.

#### Classes (Unity3D)

- ```MonoBehaviourActor```
    * Handles methods for EventBus and Data services and for Observables.

#### Helpers

- ```IEnumerable```
    * Map, Filter and Reduce alias methods using original LINQ methods.
- ```Promise```
    * Promise class to defer actions until after a previous condition is resolved.
- ```MonoBehaviour```
    * MonoBehaviour extension methods for EventBus and getting common properties.
- ```String```
    * Extension methods for creating hashes based on the string.


Documentation (Unity3D)
=====================

It's recomended to create a static class anywhere in your project to register all your services automatically.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Ju;

public static class Bootstrap
{
	[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod(RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad)]
	private static void Init()
	{
		// Generic services

		Services.RegisterService<IEventBusService, EventBusService>();
		Services.RegisterService<ITaskService, TaskService>();
		Services.RegisterService<ICoroutineService, CoroutineService>();
		Services.RegisterService<IDataService, DataService>();

		// Unity related services

		Services.RegisterService<ILogUnityService, LogUnityService>();
		Services.RegisterService<IUnityService, UnityService>();

		// Register your services here
	}
}
```

You can name the class and the method to whatever you want.


Documentation (Generic)
=====================

You can also create a static class where you name each service you use frequently as syntactic sugar:

```csharp
using Ju;

public static class Core
{
	public static T Get<T>() => Services.Get<T>();
	public static T Get<T>(string id) => Services.Get<T>(id);
	public static void Fire<T>(T msg) => Services.Get<IEventBusService>().Fire(msg);
	public static ILogService Log => Services.Get<ILogService>();
	public static IEventBusService Event => Services.Get<IEventBusService>();
	public static ITaskService Task => Services.Get<ITaskService>();
	public static ICoroutineService Coroutine => Services.Get<ICoroutineService>();
	public static IDataService Data => Services.Get<IDataService>();
	//public static IUnityService Unity => Services.Get<IUnityService>();

	// ... add more shorthands as you need
}

// Now you can use the static class Core to access your services or custom shorthand methods !
```

... and since ```Log``` service usage is very common, you can even use a wrapper to write less code when logging:

```csharp
public static class Log
{
	public static void Debug(string msg, params object[] args) => Core.Log.Debug(msg, args);
	public static void Info(string msg, params object[] args) => Core.Log.Info(msg, args);
	public static void Notice(string msg, params object[] args) => Core.Log.Notice(msg, args);
	public static void Warning(string msg, params object[] args) => Core.Log.Warning(msg, args);
	public static void Error(string msg, params object[] args) => Core.Log.Error(msg, args);
}

// Now you can use Log.Debug("test") anywhere in your code !
```

Create your service classes and make sure they inherit from ```IService``` interface.

```csharp
using Ju;

public class CustomService : IService
{
	public void Setup()
	{
		// Here you can resolve the service dependencies.
	}

	public void Start()
	{
		// Here you can initialize your service.
	}

	public void CustomMethod()
	{
	}
}
```

Then, at some point in the entry point of your program, register your services using:

```csharp
// Register a lazy service, it will initialize when used the first time only.
Services.RegisterLazyService<CustomService>();

// Register service and initialize them right away.
Services.RegisterService<CustomService>();
```

**NOTE**: If you are using Unity3D, use the tip in the Unity3D documentation above.

You can also register a object factory using:

```csharp
// A new object of type CustomClass will be created in each call.
// You can pass any function or lambda to build your new object.
Services.RegisterFactory<CustomClass>(() => new CustomClass());
```

Before the program finalizes, you should dispose the services using:

```csharp
// Dispose all services, also the event "OnApplicationQuit" will fire.
Services.Dispose();
```
